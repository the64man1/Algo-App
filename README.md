## Description

***THIS PROJECT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS! PLEASE CHECK BACK REGULARLY FOR ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITY AND AVAILABLE EXERCISES TO EXPLORE!***
    
This application allows users to view a collection (the Foodbook) of user-generated recipes, and create an account to add their own recipes to the Foodbook.

This project was completed using the MERN stack: React provides the front-end JavaScript library, MongoDB (with Mongoose as the ODM library) is the NoSQL database to store recipes and user data, Express is used for handling routing, and NodeJS provides the runtime environment. Additionally, I used the Material UI as the component library for styling.
